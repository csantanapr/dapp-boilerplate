A Starter Kit for SPA (Single Page Apps)
===

- The Boilerplate is a set of files to help you rapidly get up and running a SPA
- Helps you build your SPA which some times consumes a lot of time when starting a new SPA
- The SPA provides optional creation of Hybrid App using [Apache Cordova/PhoneGap](cordova.io)

Clone
---
    git clone https://github.com/csantanapr/dapp-boilerplate.git
    cd dapp-boilerplate

Dependencies
---
Node and cli dependencies use [NPM](http://npmjs.org):

    npm install

JavaScript use [Bower](http://bower.io) or [Volo](http://volojs.org)

    bower install
    or
    volo install

Grunt
--
Use grunt to run tasks, for available tasks run `grunt --help`

Preview Source
---
    grunt server

Preview Distribution
---
    grunt dist

Lint
---
    grunt lint
Build
---
Be happy, and stop crying because you can't figure out how to build dojo or create a hybrid App as fast and simple as it should be. Believe me I cried a lot :-(

    grunt build
Develop
---
Develop your project in `src/app/` using html,css,js,images

Hybrid App (Optional)
---
Run `cordova.sh` to build a Native App in `dist/cordova/dApp` using [Apache Cordova/PhoneGap CLI](http://cordova.io)

TODO: move codova.sh to grunt task


Debug Cordova/PhoneGap
---
Android:

    ./node_modules/.bin/cordova emulate android

Apple iOS:

    ./node_modules/.bin/cordova emulate ios



### Windows Users

If you have [msysgit](http://git-scm.com) installed, run Git Bash and verify
some dependencies by running the following commands:

    which node

Node will reward you with much faster builds.

A brief tour
----

* The starting point of the boilerplate is the file at `src/index.html` and `src/app/main.js`
  It's responsible for loading the Dojo loader and the applicationâ€™s
  bootstrapper with `config.json`
* The file `grunt build` takes your application files and builds them for
  production use using the Dojo build tool. It depends on the presence of the
  build profile at `profiles/app.profile.js` and App config `src/app/config.json` .
* The App creates an instance of `dojox/app/main` using the App Controller Configuration File  `src/app/config.json`
* The file `src/app/config.json` its the brain to compose the App and also use to figure out dependencies for Dojo Build
* The file `src/app/views/css/app.css` contains import statements to load the CSS it's inserted from `src/index.html`
* The file `src/app/views/app.js/` is an additional App Controller
* The file `src/app/views/app.html` contains the App level html template and its specified in `src/app/config.json`
* The directories inside `src/app/views/[view1 | view2 | view3]` contain View level module compose of css/images/html/js
* JS = ViewControllers, HTML=ViewTemplates
* Add View Templates, View Controllers, and Object Stores (i.e. Models) starting by modifying the `src/app/config.json`
* The provided directory structure for css, html, and js for your App is defined in config.json, you can change to a different convention

About the boilerplate
---------------------

- This project started because I always spent a few weeks getting started with a new version of Dojo, and want to give a try to the MV* dApp Framework.
- This boilerplate is constantly updated to try to reflect the latest and
greatest features and design patterns for developing Single Page App, but
it relies heavily on information and contributions from other users.
