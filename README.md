A Starter Kit for Single Page Apps
===

- The DApp Boilerplate is a set of files to help you rapidly get up and running with the dapp mvc framework.
- It illustrates some basic best practices when working with Single Web Page Apps.
- Helps you build your App which is some time the most difficult of working with
- The Single Page App is built to be use on creating a Hybrid App using [Apache Cordova/PhoneGap](cordova.io)
- Huge thanks go out to [csnover](https://github.com/csnover) and the other contributors for the original [dojo-boilerplate](https://github.com/csnover/dojo-boilerplate) project.


Quick Start
-----------

1. Clone the repository using `git clone --recursive https://github.com/csantanapr/dapp-boilerplate.git`
2. Develop your project in `src/app/` using html,css,js until it is amazing.
3. Run `build.sh`, which will create an awesome web optimized builds `dist/www`.
4. Run `.cordova.sh` builds a Native App using your web code using [Apache Cordova/PhoneGap](http://cordova.io)
5. Happiness, and stop crying because you can't figure out how to build dojo or create a hybrid App

### Windows Users

If you have [msysgit](http://git-scm.com) installed, run Git Bash and verify
some dependencies by running the following commands:

    which node

Node will reward you with much faster builds.

A brief tour
------------

* The starting point of the boilerplate is the file at `src/index.html` and `src/app/main.js`
  It's responsible for loading the Dojo loader and the applicationâ€™s
  bootstrapper with `config.json`
* The file `build.sh` takes your application files and builds them for
  production use using the Dojo build tool. It depends on the presence of the
  build profile at `profiles/app.profile.js` and App config `src/app/config.json` .
* The App creates an instance of `dojox/app/main` using the App Controller Configuration File  `src/app/config.json`
* The file `src/app/config.json` its the brain to compose the App and also use to figure out dependencies for Dojo Build
* The file `src/app/views/css/app.css` contains import statements to load the CSS it's inserted from `src/index.html`
* The file `src/app/views/app.js/` is an additional App Controller
* The file `src/app/views/app.html` contains the App level html template and its specified in `src/app/config.json`
* The directories inside `src/app/views/[view1 | view2 | view3]` contain View level module compose of css/images/html/js
* JS = ViewControllers, HTML=ViewTemplates
* Add View Templates, View Controllers, and Object Stores (i.e. Models) starting by modifying the `src/app/config.json`
* The provided directory structure for css, html, and js for your App is defined in config.json, you can change to a different convention

About the boilerplate
---------------------

- This project started because I always spent a few weeks getting started with a new version of Dojo, and want to give it a try to the MV* DApp Framework to see how it can be improved.
- This boilerplate is constantly updated to try to reflect the latest and
greatest features and design patterns for developing Single Page App, but
it relies heavily on information and contributions from other users.
- If you have an idea, suggestion, or problem, please [report
